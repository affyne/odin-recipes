      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>½ cup chana dal</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped cilantro</li>

      <p>Breading</p>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground red chile pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>

      <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a stockpot over medium heat; add ground beef. Stir in garlic paste,
        ginger paste, coriander, cumin, turmeric, garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon
        ground red chile, and salt to taste. Add water and dal; simmer until
        meat is fully cooked and all water has evaporated, 30 to 35 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend beef and dal mixture together using an immersion blender in the
        stockpot. Add 1/2 cup cilantro; blend to combine. Roll spoonfuls of beef
        and dal mixture into into walnut-sized balls; shape into smooth flat
        patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs, 1 tablespoon cilantro, 1/2 teaspoon ground red chile, and
        salt to taste together in a bowl. Place bread crumbs on a plate. Dip
        each patty into egg mixture, then roll in bread crumbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry patties in a single layer
        until golden brown and crisp, 2 to 4 minutes per side.
      </li>
    </ol>
