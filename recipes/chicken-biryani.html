    <h2>Chicken Biryani</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically
      reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such
      as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth
      it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        4 boneless skinless chicken thighs (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds), cut into
        1-inch cubes
      </li>
      <li>3/4 cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste, or 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
        plus 1 tablespoon minced garlic
      </li>

      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons biryani masala, preferably salt-free</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt, divided</li>
      <li>1 pinch saffron threads</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons milk</li>
      <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ghee</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons cumin seeds</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>8 peppercorns</li>
      <li>1 (2-inch) cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>1/2 cup French-fried onions, divided</li>
      <li>1 Roma tomato, grated</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garam masala, store-bought or homemade</li>
      <li>1/3 cup mint leaves, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup cilantro leaves, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Mix the chicken with the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice,
        biryani masala, coriander, cumin, red chilli powder, green chilli,
        turmeric, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt (only add salt if your biryani
        masala is salt-free) in a large bowl. Coat the chicken in the
        ingredients well and allow the meat to marinate, covered and
        refrigerated, for at least 2 hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 F. Combine the saffron and milk in a small bowl
        and let steep while you prepare the biryani.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the rice in a medium bowl and add cool water to cover. Let soak
        while you cook the biryani.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a deep, heavy-bottomed cooking vessel such as a Dutch oven, heat the
        ghee over medium until shimmering and add the cumin seeds, bay leaves,
        peppercorns, and cinnamon stick. Cook, stirring constantly, until the
        spices become fragrant and darken slightly, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1/4 cup of the fried onions and the tomato and cook this mixture for
        3 to 4 minutes or until the tomato turns jammy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken along with the marinade and cook, stirring occasionally,
        until the chicken loses its raw color and is almost cooked through, 12
        to 15 minutes. Add the garam masala and stir well.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the chicken is cooking, heat 5 cups of water and the remaining 1
        teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan and allow it to reach a rolling boil.
        Drain the soaked rice in a fine mesh sieve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the drained rice to the boiling water and cook for 5 to 6 minutes on
        medium heat, until al dente. Do not fully cook the rice. Drain the rice
        in a colander or strainer and keep aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the chicken is almost cooked, top it with the par-boiled rice rice,
        making sure to cover the meat fully. At this point, the rice and chicken
        both are semi-cooked and only have a few minutes further to go.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top the rice with the remaining 1/4 cup fried onions and drizzle the
        biryani with the saffron-milk mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the cooking vessel, transfer it to the preheated oven, and allow
        it to cook for about 10 minutes or until the rice is tender. Garnish
        with the cilantro and mint leaves.
      </li>
    </ol>
